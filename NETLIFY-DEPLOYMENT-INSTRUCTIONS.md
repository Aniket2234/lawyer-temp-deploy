# 🚀 Netlify Deployment Instructions - Knowledge Base Fix

Your Pocket Lawyer application is now ready for Netlify deployment with the comprehensive knowledge base data!

## ✅ What's Fixed

1. **Knowledge Base Data**: All 50 legal articles now included in Netlify function
2. **Routing**: Proper API endpoint handling for both list and individual articles
3. **Build Process**: Correct publish directory and file structure
4. **CORS**: Proper headers for cross-origin requests

## 📝 Deployment Steps

### 1. Push to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Netlify deployment - add knowledge base data"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Netlify Settings
When you redeploy on Netlify, ensure these settings:

- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Publish Directory**: `dist/public`
- **Functions Directory**: `netlify/functions`

### 3. Verify These Files Are Deployed
- `netlify/functions/api.ts` (main API handler)
- `netlify/functions/knowledgeData.ts` (50 articles data)
- `dist/public/_redirects` (routing rules)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If you still get 404 errors after redeployment:

### Check Netlify Function Logs
1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Click on your site
3. Go to "Functions" tab
4. Check if `api` function is listed and deployed
5. Click on the function to see logs

### Manual Build Verification
Run this locally to verify build:
```bash
npm run build
ls -la dist/public/  # Should show _redirects file
ls -la netlify/functions/  # Should show api.ts and knowledgeData.ts
```

### Test API Endpoint
Once deployed, test directly:
```
https://your-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/api/knowledge
```

## 📊 What's Included

Your knowledge base now has **50 comprehensive articles**:
- **Arrest Rights** (10 articles)
- **Tenant Rights** (10 articles) 
- **Cybercrime** (10 articles)
- **Women's Safety** (10 articles)
- **Consumer Complaints** (10 articles)

All focused on Indian legal system and procedures.

## 🎯 Expected Results

After successful deployment:
1. Homepage loads without errors
2. Knowledge Base shows all 50 articles
3. Category filtering works (5 categories)
4. Individual article pages load
5. Search functionality works

## 💡 Next Steps

Once deployed successfully, you can:
1. Add more legal content
2. Enable AI chat with OpenAI API key
3. Set up email notifications with SendGrid
4. Add database integration for user management

The static deployment will work perfectly with all the rich legal content you've created!
